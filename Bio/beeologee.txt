Thyroid imbalance
	Hyperthyroidism
		leads to high BP, loss of weight, overheating, irritability
		produces Graves' disease
	Hypothyroidism
		leads to low blood pressure, overweight, oftehn cold, lethargy
Thyroid hormones
	Thyroxine| regulates metabolism and development
		negative feedback to maintain thyroxine level in the blood
		not enough iodine = no feedback loop = no thyroid hormones
Calcium homeostasis
	Calcitonin (thyroid gland)
	Parathyroid hormine (PTH)
	1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (kidney)
		stimulates Ca2+ absorption by the small intestines
	helps in regulating with estrogen
		low estrogen and calcium = osteoperosis

Na+ and H2O Balance
	Atrial Natriuretic -(-)> adrenal cortex -(x)> mineral corticoids -(x)> reaborption of Na+ and H2O
	Too much blood volume| release atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)
		determines how much to urinate
		inhibits adrenal cortex secretion of aldosterone (mineral corticoids)
		increases absorbption of Na+ and water (urinate more)
Prostaglandins
	autocrine/paracrine
	regulating smooth muscle
	respose to stress
Similarities between organisms
	ligand structure
	signal transductions

Plant hormones
	ethylene| fruit ripening and other aging processes
	gibberellins| stem elongation, fruit development, seed germinati
	cytokinins| stimulate cell division
	auxins
	abscisic acid
	florigens| stimulates flowering in response to day length
		not "discovered"
	phototropism
		plants have a tendency to grow towards light
