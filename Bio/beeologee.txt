	myosin| thick filament
Sprinter vs marathon runners
	slow twitch muscles	
	fast twitch muscles
	
-=-=2/15/17=-=-
How do skeletal muscles contract?
	sliding filament model
	1) Neuronal signals (acetlcholine) activate, Na+ release generate action potential
	2) action potential pass through T tubules
	3) Ca2+ is realeased from sacroplasmic reticulum (?)
	5) Ca2+ ions trigger the power-stroke by the myosin heads
		troponin, tropomyosin, ATP. ADP + Pi
Muscle contraction
	H zone decreases in size, I band shorten in length
	T tubules allow action potentials to pass through muscle fibers quickly
	Troponin binds to calcium -> Tropomyosin twists actin -> myosin binding site revealed
	-> phosphate binds to myosin ->  muscle contraction
	
	1) tropomyosin covers the binding sites so myosin head cannot attach
	2) when binding sites of actin are exposed, myosin heads attach to binding sites
	3) myosin head flexes, pulling the thin filament pas the thick filament and shortening the sarcomere
	4) using ATP, myosin head detaches from the actin, extends, and then attaches to another actin binding site
Sprinter vs Marathoner
	slow-twitch fibers
		a lot of blood supply = more oxygen
		high concentration of mitochondria and myoglobin
		used for sustained, low-level activity (darker with NADH stain)
	fast-twtich fibers

		low concentration of mitochondria
		used for brief-duration intense activity (lighter with NADH stain)
Muscles and skeletons privide movement
	antagonistic muscles move bodies (biceps and triceps)
	three types of skeletons
		hydrostatic
			fluid held in internal compartments as a hydraulic fluid transfers force between opposing muscle sets
			muscles contract, internal volume remains the same = opposing muscles contract and extend			
		exoskeleton
			hardened, segmented outer surfaces to which internal muscles are attacted
		endoskeleton
			tendons attach muscles to the bone
