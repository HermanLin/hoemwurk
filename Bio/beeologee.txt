Chemical communication
Hormones (Endocrine glands and Neurosecretory cells)
	chemical signals
	usually carried in the blood
	cause specific changes in target cells
Hormone signaling
	reception -> signal transduction -> response
	
-=-=2/6/17=-=-
Chemical structure of hormones
	Peptides| made of amino acids
	Amino-acid derived| made of chains of amino acids
	Steroid| synthesized from cholesterol
	Prostaglandins| two fatty acid chains attached to a 5-C ring
	
-=-=2/7/17=-=-
Pituitary gland
	stores things produced by the hypothalamus
	Posterior| stores hormones from hypothalamus
		ADH regulates aquaporins (absorption of H2O in kidney)
		oxytocin = "love hormone", muscle contraction for child birth, feeling of bonding
		(-) feedback = inhibits production
		(+) feedback = stimulates production
	Anterior| makes hormones
	hypothalamus regulates pituitary
Glucose homeostasis
	Pancreas Islet of Langerhans
		alpha cells = glucagon
			increase blood glucose
		beta cells = insulin
			decrease blood glucose
	Hormones involved
		endocrine gland/cells
		class of chemicals
		signal(s) that trigger release
	Target cells/tissues/organs responses
	Diseases| diabetes (type 1/2)
Stress response
	nerve signals from hypothalamus stimulates the adrenal medulla to secrete
	
-=-=2/8/17=-=-
Thyroid imbalance
	Hyperthyroidism
		leads to high BP, loss of weight, overheating, irritability
		produces Graves' disease
	Hypothyroidism
		leads to low blood pressure, overweight, oftehn cold, lethargy
Thyroid hormones
	Thyroxine| regulates metabolism and development
		negative feedback to maintain thyroxine level in the blood
		not enough iodine = no feedback loop = no thyroid hormones
Calcium homeostasis
	Calcitonin (thyroid gland)
	Parathyroid hormine (PTH)
	1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (kidney)
		stimulates Ca2+ absorption by the small intestines
	helps in regulating with estrogen
		low estrogen and calcium = osteoperosis
		
-=-=2/10/17=-=-
Na+ and H2O Balance
	Atrial Natriuretic -(-)> adrenal cortex -(x)> mineral corticoids -(x)> reaborption of Na+ and H2O
	Too much blood volume| release atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)
		determines how much to urinate
		inhibits adrenal cortex secretion of aldosterone (mineral corticoids)
		increases absorbption of Na+ and water (urinate more)
Prostaglandins
	autocrine/paracrine
	regulating smooth muscle
	respose to stress
Similarities between organisms
	ligand structure
	signal transductions

	abscisic acid| inhibits cell growth, helps prevent water loss (closes stomata), promotes seed and bud dormancy
	florigens| stimulates flowering in response to day length
		not "discovered"
	phototropism
		plants have a tendency to grow towards light
	gravitropism
		growth in response to gravity| shoots grow up, roots grow down

Muscular-Skeletal systems (E-book: ch39)
	evolutionary convergence reflects different species' adaptations to a similar environment challenge
		branches show similar forms
Four types of tissues
	Epithelial| covers outside of body and lines the organs and cavities within the body
	Connective| binds and supports other tissues
	Muscle| long cells called muscle fibers which contract in response to nerve impulsses
		skeletal
			bands of muscles (striated)
			multiple nuclei in one muscle cell
			sacromere| the muscle contraction unit
		cardiac
			striated
			branching
			many gap junctions
		smooth
	Nervous| senses stimuli and transmits signals throughout the animal
Skeletal muscle structure
	actin| thin filament
	myosin| thick filament
Sprinter vs marathon runners
	slow twitch muscles	
	fast twitch muscles
	
-=-=2/15/17=-=-
How do skeletal muscles contract?
	sliding filament model
	1) Neuronal signals (acetlcholine) activate, Na+ release generate action potential
	2) action potential pass through T tubules
	3) Ca2+ is realeased from sacroplasmic reticulum (?)
	5) Ca2+ ions trigger the power-stroke by the myosin heads
		troponin, tropomyosin, ATP. ADP + Pi
Muscle contraction
	H zone decreases in size, I band shorten in length
	T tubules allow action potentials to pass through muscle fibers quickly
	Troponin binds to calcium -> Tropomyosin twists actin -> myosin binding site revealed
	-> phosphate binds to myosin ->  muscle contraction
	
	1) tropomyosin covers the binding sites so myosin head cannot attach
	2) when binding sites of actin are exposed, myosin heads attach to binding sites
	3) myosin head flexes, pulling the thin filament pas the thick filament and shortening the sarcomere
	4) using ATP, myosin head detaches from the actin, extends, and then attaches to another actin binding site
Sprinter vs Marathoner
	slow-twitch fibers
		a lot of blood supply = more oxygen
		high concentration of mitochondria and myoglobin
		used for sustained, low-level activity (darker with NADH stain)
	fast-twtich fibers
		thick with a lot of myofibril
		low concentration of mitochondria
		used for brief-duration intense activity (lighter with NADH stain)
Muscles and skeletons privide movement
	antagonistic muscles move bodies (biceps and triceps)
	three types of skeletons
		hydrostatic
			fluid held in internal compartments as a hydraulic fluid transfers force between opposing muscle sets
			muscles contract, internal volume remains the same = opposing muscles contract and extend			
		exoskeleton
			hardened, segmented outer surfaces to which internal muscles are attacted
		endoskeleton
			tendons attach muscles to the bone
Human skeletal systems
	bones are connective tissues
	functions
		support, protection, movement, mineral storage (Ca and P), blood cell formation (red bone marrow)
	axial| skull, ribcage, spinal cord
	appendicular| appendages
	herniated disc
		displaced spinal vertebrae
		membrane breaks, intervertebral discs leak, reduces cushioning between discs
		
-=-=2/16/17=-=-
Bones are complex living organs
	cartilage at the ends of bones
		cushions joints, reduces friction of movements 
		chondrocytes secretes glycoproteins and collagen (for lubrication)
	bone cells
		live in a matrix of flexible protein fibers and hard calcium calts
		kept alive by bloodvessels, hormones and nerves

TEST_ONE_REVIEW
Model l| relay proteins relay and magnify the signal
Model 2| phosphorylation phosphate
Model 3} secondary messenger (cEMP, calcium, etc.)
Renin -> angio___ -> adrenal cortex -> aldosterone -> increase absoprtion of water and sodium
When calcium levels are high = calcitonin (thyroid gland) -> inhibit release of calcium/increase absorption of calcium

What comes to mind?
Assexual reproduction| a method of reproducing where there is only one parent and the offspring is a copy of the parent with possible mutations

Cell cycle and asexual reproduction (Chapter 9, 11)
	types of asexual reproduction|
	DNA replication
	
	cells arise from pre-existing cells	
		when does cell division happen?
			reproduction of an entire unicellular organism
			growth of a fertilized egg into an adult in a multi-cellular organism
			repair and replacement of cells in an adult
			when the cell becomes too big
		why is it important for maintaining life?
		what will happen when cell division goes wrong?
			cancer, mutations
		why should you care about studying  cell division?

-=-=3/2/17=-=-
Result of cell division
	two daughter cells are produced
	each daughter cell recieves complete set of hereditary info from parent cell and half of cytoplasm
	the hereditary info in daughter cells is usually identical to parent
Types of asexual reproduction
	binary fission| "dividing in half", prokaryotes only
		circular DNA 
	cell division| paramecium
	budding| yeasts (b), hydra
	clones| vegetative clones
	regeneration| planarians
Eukaryotes chromosomes are more complex
	eukaryotic chormosomes are composed of chromatin (DNA + histone proteins)
		to prepare for division, chromatin becomes highly compact to form chromosomes
		early in division process, chromosomes duplicate
			each chromosome appears as two sister chromatids, containing identical DNA molecules
			the chromatids are joined at the centromere, a narrow region

Cell cycle worksheet
11) DNA needs to be replicated so the two daughter cells would be genetically identical to the parent cell
14) Division of sister chromatids
19) Human spinal cord
20) Most of the brain cells are at the G0 stage
	G0| cell arrested, doesn't continue cell cycle
	
Formation of sister chromatids
Eukaryotic chromosomes
	homologous chromosomes| eukaryotic chromosomes that contain the same genes
	diploid| cells with pairs of homologous chromosomes
	typical human has 23 pairs of chomosomes, 23rd pair are sex chromosomes
Homologous chromosomes
	usually don't have identical nucleotide sequence (mutations)
	they can have the different alleles (genes)
Mitotic phase cell division
	mitosis | division of nucleus
	cytokineseis| division of cell
