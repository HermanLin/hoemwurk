Chemical communication
Hormones (Endocrine glands and Neurosecretory cells)
	chemical signals
	usually carried in the blood
	cause specific changes in target cells
Hormone signaling
	reception -> signal transduction -> response
	
-=-=2/6/17=-=-
Chemical structure of hormones
	Peptides| made of amino acids
	Amino-acid derived| made of chains of amino acids
	Steroid| synthesized from cholesterol
	Prostaglandins| two fatty acid chains attached to a 5-C ring
	
-=-=2/7/17=-=-
Pituitary gland
	stores things produced by the hypothalamus
	Posterior| stores hormones from hypothalamus
		ADH regulates aquaporins (absorption of H2O in kidney)
		oxytocin = "love hormone", muscle contraction for child birth, feeling of bonding
		(-) feedback = inhibits production
		(+) feedback = stimulates production
	Anterior| makes hormones
	hypothalamus regulates pituitary
Glucose homeostasis
	Pancreas Islet of Langerhans
		alpha cells = glucagon
			increase blood glucose
		beta cells = insulin
			decrease blood glucose
	Hormones involved
		endocrine gland/cells
		class of chemicals
		signal(s) that trigger release
	Target cells/tissues/organs responses
	Diseases| diabetes (type 1/2)
Stress response

-=-=2/8/17=-=-
Thyroid imbalance
	Hyperthyroidism
		leads to high BP, loss of weight, overheating, irritability
		produces Graves' disease
	Hypothyroidism
		leads to low blood pressure, overweight, oftehn cold, lethargy
Thyroid hormones
	Thyroxine| regulates metabolism and development
		negative feedback to maintain thyroxine level in the blood
		not enough iodine = no feedback loop = no thyroid hormones
Calcium homeostasis
	Calcitonin (thyroid gland)
	Parathyroid hormine (PTH)
	1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (kidney)
		stimulates Ca2+ absorption by the small intestines
	helps in regulating with estrogen

Muscular-Skeletal systems (E-book: ch39)
	evolutionary convergence reflects different species' adaptations to a similar environment challenge
		branches show similar forms
Four types of tissues
	Epithelial| covers outside of body and lines the organs and cavities within the body
	Connective| binds and supports other tissues
	Muscle| long cells called muscle fibers which contract in response to nerve impulsses
		skeletal
			bands of muscles (striated)
			multiple nuclei in one muscle cell
			sacromere| the muscle contraction unit
		cardiac
			striated
			branching
			many gap junctions
		smooth
	Nervous| senses stimuli and transmits signals throughout the animal
Skeletal muscle structure
	actin| thin filament
	myosin| thick filament
Sprinter vs marathon runners
	slow twitch muscles	
	fast twitch muscles
	
-=-=2/15/17=-=-
How do skeletal muscles contract?
	sliding filament model
	1) Neuronal signals (acetlcholine) activate, Na+ release generate action potential
	2) action potential pass through T tubules
	3) Ca2+ is realeased from sacroplasmic reticulum (?)
	5) Ca2+ ions trigger the power-stroke by the myosin heads
		troponin, tropomyosin, ATP. ADP + Pi
Muscle contraction
	H zone decreases in size, I band shorten in length
	T tubules allow action potentials to pass through muscle fibers quickly
	Troponin binds to calcium -> Tropomyosin twists actin -> myosin binding site revealed
	-> phosphate binds to myosin ->  muscle contraction
	
	1) tropomyosin covers the binding sites so myosin head cannot attach
	2) when binding sites of actin are exposed, myosin heads attach to binding sites
	3) myosin head flexes, pulling the thin filament pas the thick filament and shortening the sarcomere
	4) using ATP, myosin head detaches from the actin, extends, and then attaches to another actin binding site
Sprinter vs Marathoner
	slow-twitch fibers
		a lot of blood supply = more oxygen
		high concentration of mitochondria and myoglobin
		used for sustained, low-level activity (darker with NADH stain)
	fast-twtich fibers
		thick with a lot of myofibril
		low concentration of mitochondria
		used for brief-duration intense activity (lighter with NADH stain)
Muscles and skeletons privide movement
	antagonistic muscles move bodies (biceps and triceps)
	three types of skeletons
		hydrostatic
			fluid held in internal compartments as a hydraulic fluid transfers force between opposing muscle sets
			muscles contract, internal volume remains the same = opposing muscles contract and extend			
		exoskeleton
			hardened, segmented outer surfaces to which internal muscles are attacted
		endoskeleton
			tendons attach muscles to the bone
Human skeletal systems
	bones are connective tissues
	functions
		support, protection, movement, mineral storage (Ca and P), blood cell formation (red bone marrow)
	axial| skull, ribcage, spinal cord
	appendicular| appendages
	herniated disc
		displaced spinal vertebrae
		membrane breaks, intervertebral discs leak, reduces cushioning between discs

	cartilage at the ends of bones
		cushions joints, reduces friction of movements 
		chondrocytes secretes glycoproteins and collagen (for lubrication)

		kept alive by bloodvessels, hormones and nerves

		early in division process, chromosomes duplicate
			each chromosome appears as two sister chromatids, containing identical DNA molecules
			the chromatids are joined at the centromere, a narrow region
