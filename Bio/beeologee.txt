Chemical communication
Hormones (Endocrine glands and Neurosecretory cells)
	chemical signals
	usually carried in the blood
	cause specific changes in target cells
Hormone signaling
	reception -> signal transduction -> response
	
-=-=2/6/17=-=-
Chemical structure of hormones
	Peptides| made of amino acids
	Amino-acid derived| made of chains of amino acids
	Steroid| synthesized from cholesterol
	Prostaglandins| two fatty acid chains attached to a 5-C ring

Pituitary gland
	stores things produced by the hypothalamus
	Posterior| stores hormones from hypothalamus
		ADH regulates aquaporins (absorption of H2O in kidney)
		oxytocin = "love hormone", muscle contraction for child birth, feeling of bonding
		(-) feedback = inhibits production
		(+) feedback = stimulates production
	Anterior| makes hormones
	hypothalamus regulates pituitary
Glucose homeostasis
	Pancreas Islet of Langerhans
		alpha cells = glucagon
			increase blood glucose
		beta cells = insulin
			decrease blood glucose
	Hormones involved
		endocrine gland/cells
		class of chemicals
		signal(s) that trigger release
	Target cells/tissues/organs responses
	Diseases| diabetes (type 1/2)
Stress response
	nerve signals from hypothalamus stimulates the adrenal medulla to secrete

Thyroid imbalance
	Hyperthyroidism
		leads to high BP, loss of weight, overheating, irritability
		produces Graves' disease
	Hypothyroidism
		leads to low blood pressure, overweight, oftehn cold, lethargy
Thyroid hormones
	Thyroxine| regulates metabolism and development
		negative feedback to maintain thyroxine level in the blood
		not enough iodine = no feedback loop = no thyroid hormones
Calcium homeostasis
	Calcitonin (thyroid gland)
	Parathyroid hormine (PTH)
	1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (kidney)
		stimulates Ca2+ absorption by the small intestines
	helps in regulating with estrogen
		low estrogen and calcium = osteoperosis

Na+ and H2O Balance
	Atrial Natriuretic -(-)> adrenal cortex -(x)> mineral corticoids -(x)> reaborption of Na+ and H2O
	Too much blood volume| release atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)
		determines how much to urinate
		inhibits adrenal cortex secretion of aldosterone (mineral corticoids)
		increases absorbption of Na+ and water (urinate more)
Prostaglandins
	autocrine/paracrine
	regulating smooth muscle
	respose to stress
Similarities between organisms
	ligand structure
	signal transductions

-=-=2/13/17=-=-
Plant hormones
	ethylene| fruit ripening and other aging processes
	gibberellins| stem elongation, fruit development, seed germinati
	cytokinins| stimulate cell division
	auxins
	abscisic acid
	florigens| stimulates flowering in response to day length
		not "discovered"
	phototropism
		plants have a tendency to grow towards light

Muscular-Skeletal systems (E-book: ch39)
	evolutionary convergence reflects different species' adaptations to a similar environment challenge
		branches show similar forms
Four types of tissues
	Epithelial| covers outside of body and lines the organs and cavities within the body
	Connective| binds and supports other tissues
	Muscle| long cells called muscle fibers which contract in response to nerve impulsses
		skeletal
			bands of muscles (striated)
			multiple nuclei in one muscle cell
			sacromere| the muscle contraction unit
		cardiac
			striated
			branching
			many gap junctions
		smooth
	Nervous| senses stimuli and transmits signals throughout the animal
Skeletal muscle structure
	actin| thin filament
	myosin| thick filament
Sprinter vs marathon runners
	slow twitch muscles	
	fast twitch muscles
