<h2>Lecture Outline</h2>

<p><font face="Times">I. The Endocrine System</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">A. Hormones and Other Signaling
Molecules</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. Signaling molecules are hormones
and secretions that can bind to target cells and elicit a
response.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">2. There are four main types of signaling
molecules:</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">a. Hormones are secreted from
endocrine sources and some neurons and are then transported by the
blood to remote targets.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">b. Neurotransmitters are secreted from neurons
and act on immediately adjacent target cells for a short time.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Times">c. Local signaling molecules are secreted from
cells of many different tissues; they act locally and are swiftly
degraded.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">d. Pheromones, which are secreted by exocrine
glands, have targets outside the body; they integrate social
activities between animals.</font></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">B. Discovery of Hormones and Their
Sources</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. In the early 1900s, Bayliss and
Starling first demonstrated that a hormone (later named secretin)
released into the blood triggers secretion of pancreatic
juices.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">2. Starling coined the word hormone for
internal secretions released into the bloodstream that influence the
activities of other tissues and organs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">3. The sources of hormones may be collectively
called the endocrine system, which is intimately connected to the
nervous system.</font></p></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">C. There are four main classes of chemicals
used as hormones:</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. Peptide hormones are composed of
chains of amino acids. i.e. insulin, oxytocin, TRH.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">2. A few hormones are modified amino acids. For
example, the amino acid tyrosine is the structural basis for
epinephrine (adrenaline), norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and
thyroxine.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">3. Steroid hormones are composed of
cholesterol. Testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, aldosterone, and
cortisol are steroid hormones.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">4. Prostaglandins are composed of two fatty
acid chains attached to a five carbon ring.</font></p></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">D. Modes of Action of Hormones: Signaling
Mechanisms Figure 35-2</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. A target cell's response to a
hormone is dependent on two factors:</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">a. Different hormones activate
different cellular response mechanisms.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">b. Not all cells have receptors for all
hormones; the cells that respond are selected by means of the type of
receptor they possess.</font></p></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">2. Steroid hormones, assembled from
cholesterol, are lipid&amp;endash;soluble and therefore cross plasma
membranes readily.</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">a. Steroids stimulate or inhibit
protein (especially enzyme) synthesis by switching certain genes on
or off.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">b. They easily diffuse through the lipid
bilayer of the plasma membrane, bind to chromosomal proteins in the
nucleus, and then activate transcription.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">c. Testosterone is a male hormone, with
receptors throughout the body; however, in testicular feminization
syndrome, none of the target cells respond correctly, so the XY
individual develops female characteristics.</font></p></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">3. Nonsteroid hormones include amines, amino
acids, peptides, proteins, and glycoproteins.</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">a. Protein hormones and other
water&amp;endash;soluble signaling molecules cannot cross the plasma
membrane of target cells so they must first bind to a receptor on the
plasma membrane.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">b. The hormone&amp;endash;receptor complex
stimulates the production of cyclic AMP, a "second messenger" that
amplifies the signal by activating numerous enzymes.</font></p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">E. Selected Examples of Hormonal Control</font>
</p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. When considering the actions of
hormones, three points are relevant:</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">a. Hormones interact to oppose
(antagonistic), add to (synergistic), or prime (permissive
interaction) target cells for another hormone's effects.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">b. Many hormones are linked to the
neural&amp;endash;endocrine control center by homeostatic feedback
loops.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">c. The response of target cells depends on the
number of their receptors and the concentration of the
hormone.</font></p></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">2. Consult Table 35-2 for hormone source,
secretion(s), and primary actions.</font></p></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">F. Hormones are Regulated by Feedback
Mechanisms</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. Negative feedback is an
important way of maintaining homeostasis within the body. During
negative feedback, the secretion of a hormone causes effects in
target cells that inhibit further secretion of the hormone.</font>
</p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">a. In response to loss of water
from your bloodstream, ADH causes your kidneys to reabsorb more water
and produce a very concentrated urine. Negative feedback ensures that
when your blood water content returns to normal, ADH secretion is
turned off and your kidneys begin eliminating the excess water (see
Fig 33-8).</font></p></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">2. In a few cases, positive feedback controls
hormone release. Uterus contractions during childbirth cause the
release of oxytocin. Oxytocin stimulates stringer contractions of the
uterus which causes more oxytocin to be released creating a positive
feedback cycle.</font></p></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">F. Endocrine and Exocrine Glands Figure
35-1</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. Glands are single cells or
multicelled secretory structures.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">2. Exocrine glands often secrete through ducts
to free surfaces; they secrete mucus, saliva, wax, milk, and so on
outside the body or into the digestive tract..</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">3. Endocrine glands secrete hormones directly
into intercellular fluid for distribution by the blood.</font></p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">II. The Hypothalamus and the Pituitary
Gland</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">A. The hypothalamus and pituitary
gland work jointly as the neural&amp;endash;endocrine control
center.</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. The hypothalamus is a portion of
the brain that monitors internal conditions and emotional
states.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">2. The pituitary is a pea&amp;endash;sized gland
connected to the hypothalamus by a stalk.</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">a. The posterior lobe of the
pituitary consists of nervous tissue and releases two neurohormones
made in the hypothalamus.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">b. The anterior lobe consists of glandular
tissue; it secretes six hormones and controls the release of
others.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">c. An intermediate lobe (not in humans)
produces secretions that induce changes in fur color of
vertebrates.</font></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">B. Posterior Lobe Secretions</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. The axons of neuron cell bodies
in the hypothalamus extend down into the posterior lobe of the
pituitary.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">2. Two hormones are released into the capillary
bed:</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">a. ADH acts on the walls of kidney
tubules to control the body's water and solute levels.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">b. Oxytocin triggers uterine muscle
contractions to expel the fetus and acts on mammary glands to release
milk.</font></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">C. Anterior Lobe Secretions</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. The anterior lobe releases six
hormones that stimulate ("tropic") effects on other endocrine
glands:</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">a. Corticotropin (ACTH) stimulates
the adrenal cortex.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">b. Thyrotropin (TSH) stimulates the thyroid
gland.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">c. Follicle&amp;endash;stimulating hormone (FSH)
stimulates egg formation in females and sperm formation in
males.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">d. Luteinizing hormone (LH) also acts on the
ovary to release an egg and on the testes to release sperm.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Times">e. Prolactin acts on the mammary glands to
sustain milk production.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">f. Somatotropin (STH) or growth hormone (GH)
acts on body cells in general to promote growth.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">2. The hypothalamus produces releasing and
inhibiting hormones that target the anterior pituitary.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">D. Examples of Abnormal Pituitary Output</font>
</p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. The body does not produce large
quantities of each hormone.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">2. Experience has shown that the amounts, no
matter how tiny, are critical to normal body functioning.</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">a. In childhood, too little GH can
cause pituitary dwarfism, while too much causes gigantism.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Times">b. Oversecretion of GH in adulthood causes a
thickening of skin and bones called acromegaly.</font></p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">III. The Thyroid and Parathyroid Glands</font>
</p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">A. Thyroid Functioning</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. The human thyroid gland lies at
the base of the neck in front of the trachea.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">2. Two hormones, thyroxine and
triiodothyronine, influence metabolic rates, growth, and development.
Another, calcitonin, influences calcium levels in the blood.</font>
</p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">a. The two hormones, thyroxine and
triiodothyronine, contain critical amounts of iodine.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">b. If the blood levels of iodine are too low,
the pituitary responds with too much TSH, causing the thyroid gland
to enlarge abnormally in what we call a goiter.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">3. Hypothyroidism in adults results in lethargy
and weight gain (decreased metabolic rate).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">4. Hyperthyroidism increases heart rate and
blood pressure and causes weight loss.</font></p></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">B. Parathyroid Functioning</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. These glands are embedded in the
thyroid gland and respond to changing levels of calcium in the
blood.</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">a. A drop in calcium level causes
parathyroid hormone (PTH, or parathormone) levels to rise, resulting
in removal of calcium from bone and an activation of vitamin D (to
help in calcium absorption from the gut).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">b. When calcium levels rise, the PTH levels are
reduced.</font></p></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">2. Calcitonin from the thyroid gland acts
antagonistically to PTH and promotes deposits of calcium in
bones.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">3. In response to low blood calcium, the
parathyroids release PTH which causes releases of calcium from bones.
If blood calciums become too high, the thyroid releases calcitonin
which inhibits the release of calcium from bones.</font></p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">IV. The Pancreas</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">A. The pancreas is a dual function
gland; its exocrine function is to secrete digestive enzymes.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Times">B. The endocrine portion consists of clusters
of cells called the Islets of Langerhans, or islet cells. These
islets within the pancreas are composed of three main cell
types:</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. Alpha cells secrete glucagon,
which causes glycogen stored in the liver to be converted to glucose,
raising its levels in the blood.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">2. Beta cells secrete insulin, which stimulates
the uptake of glucose by the liver, muscle, and adipose cells to
reduce glucose levels in the blood, especially after a meal.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Times">3. Delta cells secrete somatostatin, which can
inhibit the secretion of glucagon and insulin.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">C. Diabetes mellitus is a disease resulting
from imbalances of insulin; its effects include weight loss, ketone
production, water&amp;endash;solute problems, and possible death.</font>
</p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. In type 1 diabetes, insulin is
no longer produced because the beta cells have been destroyed by an
autoimmune response; treatment is by insulin injection.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">2. In type 2 diabetes, the insulin levels are
near normal but the target cells cannot respond to the hormone;
controlling diet is an effective treatment.</font></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">VI. The Sex Organs Secrete Steroid
Hormones</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. The ovaries and testes, the
gonads, produce gametes and hormones governing reproduction and
development, the menstrual cycle and pregnancy via homeostatic
feedback loops.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">2. Sex hormones also influence secondary sexual
traits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">3. The testes secrete several steroid hormones
called androgens including testosterone.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">4. The ovaries also secretes two types of
steroid hormones, estrogen and progesterone.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">5. The role of the sex hormones are discussed
in Chapters 39 and 40. Good Luck.........</font></p></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">VII. Adrenal Gland</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">A. Adrenal Medulla</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. One adrenal gland is located on
top of each kidney.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">2. This inner portion secretes epinephrine
(adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) under direction from
sympathetic nerves from the hypothalamus.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">3. Its secretions mobilize the body during
times of excitement or stress ("fight&amp;endash;or&amp;endash;flight"
response).</font></p></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">B. Adrenal Cortex</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. Among the secretions of the
outer portion are the glucocorticoids such as cortisol, which helps
control blood glucose levels (control blood glucose
metabolism).</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">a. Cortisol secretion is an example
of a homeostatic feedback loop.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">b. When blood levels of glucose fall (as in
hypoglycemia), the hypothalamus releases </font></p>

<p><font face="Times">CRH -&gt; anterior pituitary -&gt; ACTH -&gt;
adrenal cortex-&gt; cortisol, which prevents muscle cells from
withdrawing glucose from the blood.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">c. When the body is stressed, as in painful
injury, the nervous system provides an override mechanism in which
the levels of cortisol remain high to promote healing.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">2. The adrenal cortex also secretes
aldosterone. When sodium levels falls, kidney cells secrete renin,
which acts on the adrenal cortex to release aldosterone. Aldosterone
promotes sodium reabsorption by the kidneys and sweat glands.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Times">3. The adrenal cortex also produces the male
sex hormone testosterone, albeit in smaller amounts than the sex
organs produce. Tumors of the adrenal cortex sometimes leads to
excessive testosterone release causing masculinization in women. i.e.
facial hair on women, etc. </font></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">VIII. Pineal Gland</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">A. Located in the brain, this gland
is sensitive to light and seasonal influences.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">B. In the absence of light, melatonin is
secreted; thus in winter, high levels of the hormone are instrumental
in suppressing reproductive activity in hibernating animals.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Times">C. Decreased melatonin secretion in humans
might help trigger the onset of puberty. However, the function of the
human pineal gland and melatonin is still unclear.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">IX. Thymus</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">A. This gland is located behind the
breastbone and between the lungs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">B. Certain lymphocytes multiply and mature in
this gland; it also secretes groups of hormones called thymosins,
which affect the functioning of lymphocytes that defend the body
against disease (T cells).</font></p></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">X. The Kidney, Heart and Digestive Tract also
produce Hormones........</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">A. Two hormones produced by the
kidneys are important in regulating blood pressure and the blood
oxygen carrying capacity; renin and erythropoietin.</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. When blood pressure falls, the
kidneys release renin into the bloodstream. Renin acts as an enzyme
catalyzing the formation of a second hormone angiotensin. Angiotensin
in turn causes arterioles to constrict elevating blood pressure.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">2. Constriction of the arterioles carrying
blood to the kidneys also reduces the rate of blood filtration
causing less water to be removed from the blood. Water retention
causes an increase in blood volume and hence an increase in blood
pressure. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times">3. In response to low blood oxygen levels, the
kidneys release a second hormone erythropoietin. Erythropoietin
travels in the blood to the bone marrow where it stimulates more
rapid production of red blood cells whose role is to transport
oxygen.</font></p></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">B. Atrial Natriuretic peptide (ANP), produced
by cells in the atria of the heart, causes reduction of blood volume
by decreasing the release of both ADH (water reabsorption; arterial
constriction) and aldosterone (sodium reabsorption).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">C. Four gastrointestinal hormones play roles in
the digestive system.</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. Gastrin, produced by the stomach
lining, stimulates secretion of acids into the stomach.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">2. Secretin, from the intestinal lining,
stimulates sodium bicarbonate secretions from the pancreas to
neutralize the acidity of the incoming chyme.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">3. Cholecystokinin enhances the actions of
secretion and stimulates gallbladder contractions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">4. GIP (gastric inhibitory peptide), released
in the presence of glucose and fat, inhibits acid production and
peristalsis in the stomach.</font></p></blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">D. Effects of Some Local Signaling
Molecules</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. Prostaglandins are produced in
tissues throughout the body; their actions remain localized near the
site of secretion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">2. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) influences the
growth of many cell types.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">3. Nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes growth
and survival of neurons in the developing embryo.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Times">E. Comparative Look at a Few Invertebrate
Hormones</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Times">1. Molting in arthropods is
controlled by hormones.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">2. Ecdysone promotes molting in insects;
juvenile hormone retards the same process.</font></p></blockquote>
