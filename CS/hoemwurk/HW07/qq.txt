2x2
|Q| |
| | |
Found no solution
This has no solution because 1 queen immediately invalidates the other
available corners of the 2x2, therefore allowing only 1 queen.

3x3
|Q| | |
| | |Q|
| | | |
Found no solution
This has no solution because 1 queen anywhere on the edge of the board
gives you two options to place queens, but those two options are always
in range of another queen i.e another queen will be able to capture the
other queen.

| | |Q| |
Found 2 solutions
This has only 2 solutions, based off of one fundamental solution. Putting
a queen in one corner will only allow 2 knight's moves of placements. The
fourth one from this method will always be a diagonal away from another
queen. Placing a queen in on the edge (which has two possible spots, 
creating 2 solutions), however, and following a knight's move allows for 
one fundamental solution.

Found 10 solutions
Like the 4x4, each fundamental solution has it's own variations of placements.
The first one has 4 variations, the second one has 2 variations, and the third
one has 4 variations, adding up to a total of 10.

First fundamental solution has 2 variations and the second fundamental solution
has 2 more variations, totaling 4 possible solutions.
