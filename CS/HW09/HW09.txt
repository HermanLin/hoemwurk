-=-=Knight's Tour=-=-
Goal: 
Touch every square on an nxn board exactly once
or to determine that this task is possible

Steps:
1) Place the knight on the first valid position
2) Move to the first possible position (an L-shape from the original spot)
3) Repeat Step 2 until there are no more possible moves
4) If the number of moves made is not equal to n^2, backtrack to a new position

Solution: 
When the number of moves made is equal to n^2 and a closed trip is possible

Things to consider:
- What is considered as the "first possible position" when moving the knight
- Difference between an open and closed trip
